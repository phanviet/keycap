<p>An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.</p>

<p>Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown
species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where
its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have
been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought
to North America by European colonists.</p>
